          indicates that the candidate object is classified as an{" "}
          <em>exoplanet</em>. Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside
          our Solar System. They are identified through detection methods such
          as the transit method (a dip in starlight when a planet passes in
          front of its star) or radial velocity (the starâ€™s wobble due to
          gravitational pull). If the response is <strong>PLANET</strong>, it
          means the observed signal is consistent with a genuine planetary body.

        <span className="text-white">
          <strong className="text-gray-500">NOT PLANET</strong>: This label
          means that the candidate signal does not correspond to a true
          exoplanet. Instead, it may be explained by other astrophysical
          phenomena, such as binary stars, background eclipsing systems, stellar
          variability, or even instrumental noise. If the response is{" "}
          <strong>NOT PLANET</strong>, the data suggests the signal cannot be
          reliably attributed to a planetary body.
