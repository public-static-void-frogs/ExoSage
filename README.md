# NASA space app challenge 2025
This repository contains solution developed for NASA space app challenge 2025 ['A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI'](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/challenges/a-world-away-hunting-for-exoplanets-with-ai/).

So as to address the challenge we developed an ml-powered web application. We trained a TCN model on data from NASA's exoplanets archive. The model's inferense was developed as a part of the back-end using FastAPI and PyTorch. The front-end part of the application was developed on React. More information about the project and research can be found on [NASA space app website](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/spaceworms2/?tab=project).
